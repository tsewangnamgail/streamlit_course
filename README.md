# Streamlit Crash Course Projects

## Description
This repository contains a structured learning path to master **Streamlit** through hands-on projects and exercises. It covers fundamental concepts and builds up to interactive, professional-level applications using Python core libraries such as **Streamlit**, **pandas**, and **numpy**.

You will learn how to create interactive apps, build dashboards, work with real data, and deploy your applications — all from a single Python file per app. This project is based on tutorials from a YouTube Streamlit crash course.

- **Set up and run Streamlit projects locally.**  
- **Build interactive user interfaces** with forms, sliders, buttons, and dropdowns.  
- **Structure apps** with layouts like columns, sidebars, and expanders.  
- **Load, filter, and display real data** using pandas.  
- **Create dashboards** with KPI cards and charts using only built-in Streamlit features.  
- **Deploy Streamlit apps** to Streamlit Cloud.
